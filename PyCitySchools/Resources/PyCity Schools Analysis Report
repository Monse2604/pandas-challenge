PyCity Schools Analysis Report
Summary of the Analysis
The analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of students in a district of 15 schools, serving a total of 39,170 students, with an overall budget of $24,649,428. The district's average math score is 79, and the average reading score is 82. However, only 65.17% of students passed both math and reading, while 74.98% passed math and 85.81% passed reading individually. The results were further analyzed by examining performance across different spending ranges per student, school size, and school type.

Conclusions
Impact of Spending on Student Performance: The analysis revealed that schools with lower spending per student tend to perform better. For instance, schools that spent less than $585 per student had the highest average math (83.5) and reading scores (84.0), along with the highest overall passing rate (90.37%). In contrast, schools with higher spending per student ($645-680) had lower average scores (77 for math and 81 for reading) and a significantly lower overall passing rate (53.53%). This trend suggests that higher spending does not necessarily correlate with better student outcomes in this district, potentially indicating inefficiencies in resource allocation or other factors affecting student performance.

Effect of School Size on Student Outcomes: Smaller schools (with fewer than 1,000 students) showed higher performance compared to larger schools (2,000-5,000 students). Small schools had an overall passing rate of 89.88%, whereas large schools had a passing rate of only 58.29%. This difference in performance could be attributed to more personalized attention and smaller class sizes in smaller schools, allowing for better student engagement and support. Medium-sized schools (1,000-2,000 students) also performed well, with an overall passing rate of 90.62%, indicating that moderate school sizes may strike a balance between student-teacher ratios and resource availability.

School Type Analysis: Charter vs. District Schools: Charter schools outperformed district schools in all key metrics. Charter schools had an average math score of 83.38 and a reading score of 84.0, while district schools scored 77.0 in math and 81.0 in reading. The overall passing rate for charter schools was 90.43%, compared to 53.67% for district schools. This suggests that the charter schools in this district may have more effective teaching methods, better resource utilization, or other factors that contribute to higher student achievement.
